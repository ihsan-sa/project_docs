# Lorentz Solver

This Lorentz solver is designed to compute the paths of particles in complex custom electromagnetic spaces and then animate them using the Manim library for maximum clarity.

## The Lorentz Force and solvers

A Lorentz solver is a simulation tool which simulates the effect of the Lorentz force on particles in various electromagnetic spaces. The Lorentz force on a charge particle is described by the following equation:


$$
F = q(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B})
$$


where  is the Lorentz force,  is the charge on the particle,  and  are the vector describing the electric and magnetic fields at the location of the particle respectively, and  is the velocity of the particle. For more details on the scientific principles and equations involved in the simulations of various objects in different spaces, please see the Physics and Math page.
